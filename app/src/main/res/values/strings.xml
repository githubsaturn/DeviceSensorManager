    <string name="about_text">This is an example app to show how sensors can be accessed in an Android App.
        The app scans your device and finds all sensors available on the device. You can select a sensor and monitor
        the sensor reading in real-time. You can also record the readings and email the raw data for post-processing.
        You can select multiple sensors (up to 5) at the same time and have their measurement recorded.
        \n
        \nThis is an open-source free project. The source code is available on <a href="http://github.com/githubsaturn/DeviceSensorManager">GitHub</a>.
        Please feel free to drop me a line if you have any question \n
        \nYou can select any sensor that is available on your device and read the measurement from the sensor.</string>
